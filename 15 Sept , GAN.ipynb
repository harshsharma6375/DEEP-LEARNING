    "what is gang (genrative adversial network )\n",
    "\n",
    "1) it is a deep learning model that can generate new data that looks like real data .\n",
    "for example ->  creating fake images of faces that looks real \n",
    "\n",
    "2) genrative art , music , text or videos data augmentation in ml or dl .\n",
    "\n",
    "GAN has two neural network that play a game against each other .\n",
    "1) generator -> The genrator is a neural network that creates fake data like images , text ,\n",
    "sound it doesnot get real data directly , instead it starts with random noise \n",
    "(a vector of numbers )and its goal is to make  the full the discriminator by generating data \n",
    "that looks real \n",
    "\n",
    "how does it works \n",
    "input -> it will take random noise , for processing it passes noise through layers of neural network \n",
    "then as an output it generates a synthetic data sample . \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) discriminator -> it is a neural network classifier it sees both real data and fake data and its goal is to correctly classify whether the input is real then a 1 or fake n is 0 .\n",
    "\n",
    "how does it works \n",
    "As an input it will take an data sample an either real from dataset or fake from generator therefore processing it passes through neural network layers then\n",
    "as an output it calculates the output based on the probabilty between 0 to 1 .  \n",
    "if it is closer to 0 then it is fake and if it is closer to 1 then it is real . \n",
    "\n",
    "how does gan works \n",
    "\n",
    "step 1 -> input random noise \n",
    "generator doesnot get real data at first , it start with random noise vector \n",
    "\n",
    "step 2 -> generator produce fake data \n",
    "it is used in the noise then the generator outputs (Gz) as a fake sample \n",
    "\n",
    "step 3 -> discriminator gudges \n",
    "discriminator sees both real data (x) and fake data (Gz and it returns the output  1 if it things input is real . returns 0 when if fake , If it thinks \n",
    "the input is fake \n",
    "\n",
    "step 4 -> Adversial training \n",
    "generator want to fool the discriminator and discriminator wants to catch the\n",
    "generators lies . \n",
    "\n",
    "step 5 -> \n",
    "Loss function \n",
    "discriminator loss is ld = -(log d(x)  + log(1-d(Gz)))\n",
    "if it return 1 and for fake it will return 0 . \n",
    "\n",
    "genrator loss \n",
    "lg = -(log d(Gz))\n",
    "it wants fake to be just as real = 1 \n",
    "\n",
    "step - 6 -> Training the loop \n",
    "train discriminator means make it better at catching phase \n",
    "train generator -.  Means make it better at fooling discriminator then repeat until generator produce realistic data \n",
    "\n",
    "step -7 -> Variants of gan\n",
    "DC gan -> Better for images \n",
    "cycle gan -> convert one type to another \n",
    "style gan -> it generates ultra realistic human faces . \n",
    "\n",
    "challanges of GAN\n",
    "1) training in stability -> it is hard to  balance generator and discriminator \n",
    "2) more collapse  -> genrator produces limited variety of output \n",
    "3) it needs lot of data and computer power \n",
    "4) ethical concerns -> deep fake , fake media . "
